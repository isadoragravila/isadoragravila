### Hi there 👋

My name is **Isadora Guimarães Ribeiro de Ávila** and I'm a student of **Full Stack Development** at Driven Education.

I'm a Civil Engineering graduate from UFTM (Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro) and also a beach tennis player in my free time.

I'm currently a member of the Rotaract Club of my hometown. The club is engaged in social projects that aim to help the local community and also it's focused on developing its members leadership skills.
